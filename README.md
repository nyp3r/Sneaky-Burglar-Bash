## Style
I chose to follow Godot's style guide: [https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html)

## Design patterns
I use the state machine design pattern for the player, when they're armed or unarmed.
It's a very common and simple pattern which meant I could use a script from someone else to set it up.
